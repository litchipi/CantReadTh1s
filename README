Just a simple encrypter / decrypter utility

Use:
    cantreadthis [--out <fname> --testing] <filename>
        If this is an encrypted file, will prompt for decryption
        If this is not an encrypted file, will prompt for encryption
    
Data is stored encrypted using AES 256, compressed with zlib.

Not suited to hide anything from the government
Please mess with it, but don't use it

Exemples:
    cantreadthis secret_data
        Will create a file named "secret_data.cant_read_this" processed

    cantreadth1s --out outfile secret_data.cant_read_this
        Will output to file "outfile" the data recovered from secret_data.cant_read_this

    cantreadthis secret_message.cant_read_this
        Will print on the screen the data recovered from secret_message.cant_read_this

    cantreadth1s --testing foo
        Will launch tests on the process (filename doesn't matter)
