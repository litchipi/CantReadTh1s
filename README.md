# CantReadTh1s
Just a simple encryption / decryption tool

Not suited for real cryptographic security.
Please mess with it, but don't use it for anything important

## Usage:
```
       cantreadth1s [-h] [--outfile OUTFILE] [--info INFO]
                    [--security-level SECURITY_LEVEL]
                    [--find-parameters FIND_PARAMETERS]
                    filename

positional arguments:
  filename              The file you want to process/recover

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --outfile OUTFILE, -o OUTFILE
                        Where to save the recovered data (if nothing is
                        passed, will print it in stdout)
  --info INFO, -i INFO  Information about the file, its content or an
                        indication of the password
  --security-level SECURITY_LEVEL, -l SECURITY_LEVEL
                        Security level to use, changes the parameters of the
                        password derivation function. Can go to infinite,
                        default is 1.
  --find-parameters FIND_PARAMETERS, -f FIND_PARAMETERS
                        Tests the parameters needed to get the given execution
                        time (in ms)
```
#### If \<filename\> is an encrypted file:
- Will display the information about the file (passed by the --info option when it was created)
- Will ask password for decryption
- if --out option is set, will write to the file specified
- else, will display the result to stdout

#### If \<filename\> is a non-encrypted file:
- Will ask password for encryption
- Will store the information about the file (passed by the --info option, default info is the version of CantReadTh1s used)
- Will create file \<filename\>.cant_read_th1s which contains the compressed and encrypted data

### Data verification
A file processed by this tool will get a header containing the data SHA256 hash, and the length of the data.
This way a corrupted / manipulated data will get detected by the tool and the user will be notified.

### Technical details
- Data is stored encrypted using AES 256
- Data compressed with zlib
- Header stored in JSON, previously compressed with SMAZ
- Password Key Derivation with Argon2, with flexible settings (defaults are t=2, m=1024, p=Number of CPU x2)

###Â Security levels
To fit particular needs, the tool can be used with different levels of security that can be added to the default minimal settings for more security.
This affects the password derivation function (Argon2 hash) parameters, but may affect other aspects too as the tool gets developped.
```
    cantreadth1s -l 50 <file>
```
Will process the file \<file\> with a level of security of 50.
```
    cantreadth1s -f 500 <dummyfile>
```
Will find the maximal security parameters allowing to get ~ 500ms of password hashing time

### Python usage
The "CantReadThis" class permits any other script to very simply load the tool into an existing project. A very simple example can be seen within the test_script.py file inside this repository.

### Exemples
```
cantreadthis secret_data
```
Will create a file named "secret_data.cant_read_this" processed

```
cantreadth1s --info "the password is TATA" secret_data
```
Will create the file secret_data.cant_read_this
When someone will try to decrypt this file with cantreadth1s again, it will display the information
"the password is TATA". (This is a terrible idea, don't do this)

```
cantreadth1s --out outfile secret_data.cant_read_this
```
Will output to file "outfile" the data recovered from secret_data.cant_read_this

```
cantreadthis secret_message.cant_read_this
```
Will print on the screen the data recovered from secret_message.cant_read_this



```
cantreadth1s --testing foo
```
Will launch tests (filename doesn't matter)

### TODO plans

In order of priority
* Compression of data before encryption (if not, compression ~ useless)
* Fix mutliprocessing & AES encryption
* Process a whole directory
* Split file into smaller chunks (and reverse process)
* Improve speed with Cython
* Non-interactive password prompt (directly from function call)
* Verifications of the tool security
* Very simple GUI tool for non-cli users
* Comment the code :-(
* Use steganography to store the data inside an image (and reverse process)
* Split file into smaller chunks inside a list of images by steganography (and reverse process)
* Better benchmarking functions
* Adding encryption & compression choices
